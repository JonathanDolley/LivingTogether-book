<p>This is a book about <a href="http://www.hansalim.or.kr/">Hansalim</a>, a cooperative in South Korea that has grown from a small rice market on the outskirts of Seoul in 1986 to become one of the world’s largest organic food cooperatives with 750,000 members and producers. Through this research I want to find out what lessons their experience holds for other cooperative groups and movements in europe and beyond as we strive to transform our food systems away from industrialized models towards a fairer and more sustainable future.</p>
<!--The writing of this book also provides an opportunity for Hansalim and their research center, Mosim, to reflect on their experience and the successes and challenges they have faced along the way. By thinking critically about their own story I believe -->
<p>The research and writing of this book is funded by the EU’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions through a Global Fellowship led by Dr Jonathan Dolley and supervised by the University of Sussex, UK and the <a href="http://www.mosim.or.kr/">Mosim and Salim Research Institute</a> in Seoul, Korea. The title of my research fellowship is ‘Hansalim as a model for solidarity pathways towards sustainable food systems’. This book is to be the main output from my research along with several academic papers. The project website is <a href="https://www.livingtogether.xyz">www.livingtogether.xyz</a> where I will post updates on the research as I go along.</p>
<p>This book is a work in progress that I plan to publish “in real time” so to speak, as it is being written. A kind of open access, open source book.</p>
<p>It is already a collaborative project with co-authors at the Mosim and Salim Research Institute and I hope that this collaboration can extend to it’s readers as well, through the use of comments and discussions and also through suggested edits via GitHub. So we welcome any input from interested readers who share a passion for the topic of organic and regenerative farming and the cooperative and solidarity economy.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved but you have never heard of GitHub I have written a <a href="/github.html">brief explanation</a> in appendix in this book that will hopefully help.</p>
