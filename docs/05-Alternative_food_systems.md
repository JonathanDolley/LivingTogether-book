# Hansalim as an emerging alternative food system

  - Description of the food production & supply system.
  - Analysis of enablers, constraints and strategies food system transformation for (internal & external / bottom-up & top-down).
  - Evaluation of economic, environmental and social outcomes. Including qualitative data from chapter 2-4 plus interviews and quantitative data from Hansalim's records.
  - Social justice: in what ways does Hansalim's alternative food system tackle poverty and exclusion and empower the poor? What enables or constrains this work?
  - What future strategies can extend Hansalim's food system transformation? E.g. finding new ways to incorporate urban and peri-urban agriculture; strategies to replicate or expand Hansalim's approach; what future priorities to pursue; redesigning processes to cope with larger organization. Drawing on my own research, academic literature and Hansalim's experience and research.
