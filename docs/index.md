description: "This 3 year research project is a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action - Global Fellowship led by Dr Jonathan Dolley and supervised by the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU, University of Sussex Business School, UK) and the Mosim and Salim Research Institute (South Korea). Through this project I am investigating the story of the Korean cooperative, Hansalim, which grew from a small rice market on the outskirts of Seoul in 1986 to become one of the worlds largest organic food cooperatives with 750,000 members and producers. I want to find out what lessons their experience holds for other cooperative groups and movements in the UK and EU as we strive to transform our food systems away from industrialized models towards a fairer and more sustainable future. Hence the title of the fellowship: 'Hansalim as a model for solidarity pathways towards sustainable food systems'. This book is to be the main output from my research."

# Welcome {-}

This book is a work in progress that I plan to publish "in real time" so to speak, as it is being written.

It is a collaborative project with co-authors and I hope that this collaboration can extend to it's readers as well through the use of comments and discussions and also through suggested edits via github. So we welcome any input from interested readers who share a passion for the topic of organic and regenerative farming and the cooperative and solidarity economy.
